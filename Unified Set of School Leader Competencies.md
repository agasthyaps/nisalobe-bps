## Framing: About These Competencies

### Why were they built?
To provide a guide for planning professional learning experiences for BPS leaders.

### What is a competency?
Competencies describe the **attitudes, knowledge, and skills** that school leaders in Boston need to close opportunity and achievement gaps. They are transferable across multiple contexts within the daily work of school leaders and help plan professional development that is coherent and aligned to the district's vision.

### Relationship to good instruction
These competencies are complementary to other coherence-building efforts (e.g., the IPP, which articulates the vision for teaching and learning). The competencies describe the **leadership actions** that enable effective teaching and learning.

### Role in other district efforts
The competencies intentionally build coherence by connecting school leader beliefs, mindsets, and skills back to the district's strategic implementation plan. They focus on the behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge school leaders need to close opportunity and achievement gaps.

### Relationship to evaluation
The competencies touch on all four standards for professional practice. School leaders continue to be evaluated using the standards for professional practice; the competencies **drive learning opportunities** rather than serving as an evaluation tool directly. Developing and mastering these competencies supports successful summative evaluation.

### How were they created?
Under the direction of the superintendent, deputy superintendent for ASSET, and chief of schools, a cross-office team from Bolling developed the initial draft for school leader feedback and continued development.
