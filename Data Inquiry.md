## What is Data Inquiry?

Data Inquiry is a scaffolded, cyclical process that guides teams of teachers and school leaders to:

- Identify student learning challenges based on data
- Examine instruction to understand how teaching impacts learning
- Design high-leverage instructional strategies
- Assess progress in student learning and teacher practice
- Refine and adjust practice until student learning improves
- Discover their own professional learning needs

### Core Concept: "Sphere of Success"

Every school has a **sphere of success** -- the group of students with whom the school is currently successful. The goal of inquiry is to **continually expand that sphere to include all students**. Inquiry teams iteratively drill down to increasingly specific and immediate data to:

1. Hone understanding of the learning challenges students face
2. Increase the specificity and alignment of instructional responses

Engaging in collaborative inquiry increases **teacher efficacy** as teams see the direct impact their teaching has on student learning.

## The Data Wise Improvement Process

BPS uses the **Data Wise Improvement Process** (from the Harvard Graduate School of Education) to lead schools through cycles of collaborative inquiry. The process develops practices and habits of mind necessary for continuous improvement through **three phases**:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Prepare** | Teams establish team structures and expectations, and learn principles of responsible data use. |
| **2. Inquire** | Teams look for patterns in data that indicate areas for improving teaching and learning. |
| **3. Act** | Teams design and implement instructional improvements based on what they learn. |

**Authors:** Kathy Boudett, Elizabeth City, and Richard Murnane

## Coaching Model and Framework

### Philosophy: Building Teacher Skill and Team Capacity

Collaborative inquiry is a vehicle for **distributing school leadership** and augmenting the capacity of individual teachers and teams to understand and resolve student learning challenges. The focus is on increasing the **autonomy and mastery** of school team members to achieve sustainable and scalable improvement.

### The Role of Inquiry Facilitators

The BPS Data Inquiry Team coaches teams at 30+ schools. Each school is matched with an Inquiry Facilitator who coaches team facilitators to:

- Lead collaborative inquiry cycles
- Facilitate adult learning
- Utilize practical tools for identifying and addressing student learning challenges

Inquiry Facilitators differentiate support by providing intensive coaching to the Principal and (depending on model) the ILT and select staff.
